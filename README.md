# Assignment 2 - Feed Me! AKA Yelp

Feed Me! is an iPhone application to browse restaurants via the Yelp API.

Submitted by: Sara Hender

Time spent: way too much for how few optionals I implemented, I should have asked for help

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

Search results page
* [X] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
* [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
* [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar

Filter page
* [X] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
* [X] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
* [X] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.

Optional
For the optional feature I implemented the restaurant detail page with a map pointing to it's location.

## Notes

I really need to get a better handle on passing data between view controllers.
